# Client-Server-Communication

The server maintains a number of client accounts. A client (say Alice) gets the list of other clients when she logs onto the server. Alice sends a text message to other client (say Bob). Next, when Bob logs onto the server, he retrieves his text messages. After seeing Aliceâ€™s message, Bob starts a new TCP connection with Alice to chat with her.
